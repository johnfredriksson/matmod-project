## Prerequisites
* Make sure that you have Python and pip installed on your machine. If you are using the Anaconda distribution, you should also have the conda command available.
## Setup
1. ### Clone or download the repository.

2. ### Install dependencies
    - If you are using pip:
        - Navigate to the root directory of the repository
        - Run the following command to create a new virtual environment and install the required packages:
        ```
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    - If you are using conda:

        - Run the following command to create a new environment using the environment.yml file provided and install the required packages:

        ```
        conda env create -f environment.yml
        ```
3. ### Running the notebook
    - If you are using Jupyter Notebook:

        - Activate the virtual environment you created in step 2 (if using pip) or the environment you created in step 3 (if using conda).

        - From the root directory of the repository, run the following command:

        ```
        jupyter notebook
        ```

        - This will open a new browser window with the Jupyter Notebook interface. From there, you can navigate to the .ipynb file and open it.
